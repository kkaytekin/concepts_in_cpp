# CIIP C++ Course

Welcome to the CIIP course **Concepts of C++ programming**!

You will use this [`git`](https://git-scm.org) repository for solving and submitting homeworks.


[[_TOC_]]


You'll have a personal "fork" of this repo containing your code.
We will publish new homeworks (and bugfixes :) **in the base repo**, which you then merge into **your repo**.
How to do that [is described later](#TODO).
